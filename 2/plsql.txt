f) Write a PL/SQL program to copy the contents of the Shipment table to another table for maintaining 
    records for specific part number.

CREATE TABLE SHIPMENTS(PID VARCHAR(5), SID VARCHAR(5), qty NUMBER(3), PRIMARY KEY(PID, SID))

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
DECLARE
    s_pid supply.pid%type;
    s_sid supply.sid%type;
    s_qty supply.qty%type;
    CURSOR c1
    IS SELECT pid, sid, qty
    FROM supply;

BEGIN
    OPEN c1;
    LOOP
        FETCH c1 INTO s_pid, s_sid, s_qty;
        EXIT WHEN c1%notfound;
        INSERT INTO SHIPMENTS VALUES(s_pid, s_sid, s_qty);
    END LOOP;
        CLOSE c1;
    dbms_output.put_line('Succesfully copied contents of supply into shipment');
END;
