Consider the Book Lending system from the library- BOOKS, STUDENT,BORROWS. The students
    are allowed to borrow any number of books on a given date from the library. The details of the book
    should include ISBN, Title of the Book, author and publisher. All students need not compulsorily
    borrow books.
        a) Mention the constraints neatly.
        b) Design the ER diagram for the problem statement
        c) State the schema diagram for the ER diagram.
        d) Create the above tables, insert suitable tuples and perform the following operations
        in SQL:
            1. Obtain the name of the student who has borrowed the book bearing ISBN ‘123’
            2. Obtain the Names of female students who have borrowed database books.
            3. Find the number of books borrowed by each student. Display the student
            details along with the number of books.
