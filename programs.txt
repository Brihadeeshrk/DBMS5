Exercise-II {
    Consider the relations: PART, SUPPLIER and SUPPLY. The Supplier relation holds information
    about suppliers. The attributes SID, SNAME, SADDR describes the supplier. The Part relation holds
    the attributes such as PID, PNAME and PCOLOR. The Shipment relation holds information about
    shipments that include SID and PID attributes identifying the supplier of the shipment and the part
    shipped, respectively. The Shipment relation should contain information on the number of parts
    shipped.
        a) Mention the constraints neatly.
        b) Design the ER diagram for the problem statement
        c) State the schema diagram for the ER diagram.
        d) Create the above tables, insert suitable tuples and perform the following operations in
        Oracle SQL:
            1. Obtain the details of parts supplied by supplier #SNAME.
            2. Obtain the Names of suppliers who supply #PNAME.
            3. Delete the parts which are in #PCOLOR.
        e) Create the table, insert suitable tuples and perform the following operations using
        MongoDB
            1. Update the details of parts for a given part identifier: #PID.
            2. Display all suppliers who supply the part with part identifier: #PID.
        f) Write a PL/SQL program to display the contents of the above tables and then
        update the quantity of parts shipped by 5%.

Exercise-III {
    Consider the relations BOAT, SAILOR and RESERVES. The relation BOAT identifies the features
    of a boat such as unique identifier, color and a name. The list of sailors with attributes such as SailorID,
    name, age etc., are stored in the relation SAILOR. The sailors are allowed to reserve any number of
    boats on any day of the week and the records are to be updated in the RESERVES table.
        a) Mention the constraints neatly.
        b) Design the ER diagram for the problem statement
        c) State the schema diagram for the ER diagram.
        d) Create the tables, insert suitable tuples and perform the following operations in SQL:
            1. Obtain the details of the boats reserved by ‘#Sailor_Name’.
            2. Retrieve the BID of the boats reserved necessarily by all the sailors.
            3. Find the number of boats reserved by each sailor. Display the Sailor_Name
            along with the number of boats reserved.
        e) Create the table, insert suitable tuples and perform the following operations using
        MongoDB.
            1. Obtain the number of boats obtained by sailor :#Sailor_Name
            2. Retrieve boats of color :”#color”
        f) Write a PL/SQL program to check whether a given number is prime or not.

Exercise-IV {
    Consider the Shipment – Warehouse case study. Different parts like nut, bolts etc., are being 
    shipped to different warehouses. The quantity and date of shipment are recorded for each part 
    stored within the warehouse. The address of the warehouse also stored for shipment purposes.
        a) Mention the constraints neatly.
        b) Design the ER diagram for the problem statement
        c) State the schema diagram for the ER diagram.
        d) Create the above tables, insert suitable tuples and perform the following operations in
        SQL:
            1. Obtain the Names of warehouses which have shipped red colored parts.
