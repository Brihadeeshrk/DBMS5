Consider the Shipment â€“ Warehouse case study. Different parts like nut, bolts etc., are being 
    shipped to different warehouses. The quantity and date of shipment are recorded for each part 
    stored within the warehouse. The address of the warehouse also stored for shipment purposes.
        a) Mention the constraints neatly.
        b) Design the ER diagram for the problem statement
        c) State the schema diagram for the ER diagram.
        d) Create the above tables, insert suitable tuples and perform the following operations in
        SQL:
            1. Obtain the Names of warehouses which have shipped red colored parts.
            2. Retrieve the PNO of the parts shipped by all the warehouses.
            3. Find the number of parts supplied by each warehouse.
            4. List the warehouse details which ships maximum quantity of parts.
