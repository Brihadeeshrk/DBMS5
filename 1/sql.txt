Consider an Employee with a social security number (SSN) working on multiple projects with definite
hours for each. Each Employee belongs to a Department. Each project is associated with some domain
areas such as Database, Cloud and so on. Each Employee will be assigned to some project. Assume
the attributes for Employee and Project relations.
    a) Mention the constraints neatly.
    b) Design the ER diagram for the problem statement
    c) State the schema diagram for the ER diagram.
    d) Create the tables, insert suitable tuples and perform the following operations in SQL
        1. Obtain the details of employees assigned to “Database” project.
        2. Find the number of employees working in each department
        3. Update the Project details of Employee bearing SSN = #SSN to ProjectNo =
        #Project_No and display the same.

a)  EMPLOYEE - PRIMARY KEY(SSN)
    PROJECT - PRIMARY KEY(PNO)
    WORKS_ON - PRIMARY KEY(PNO, SSN)
                FOREIGN KEY (SSN)
                FOREIGN KEY (PNO)

b) -

c) - 

d) 
CREATE TABLE employee (
    SSN varchar(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name varchar(15),
    Department_No number(3),
    Salary number(5)
);

CREATE TABLE project (
    Pno number(3) PRIMARY KEY,
    PDomain varchar(10)
);

CREATE TABLE works_on (
    SSN varchar(10),
    Pno number(3),
    Hours number(2),
    PRIMARY KEY (SSN, PNO),
    FOREIGN KEY (SSN) REFERENCES employee(SSN),
    FOREIGN KEY (Pno) REFERENCES project(Pno)
);

i)  SELECT *
    FROM employee
    WHERE SSN IN (
                SELECT SSN
                FROM works_on
                WHERE Pno = (
                            SELECT Pno
                            FROM project
                            WHERE PDomain = 'DATABASE'
                )
    );

ii) SELECT COUNT(*), Department_No
    FROM employee E
    GROUP BY Department_No;

    // YOU HAVE TO USE JOINS HERE -> BECAUSE THEYVE MENTIONED ALONG WITH DEPARTMENT DETAILS
    ASSUMING WE HAVE A SEPARATE TABLE FOR DEPARTMENT => | DNO | DNAME |
    SO,
    IN THIS EXAMPLE, I HAVENT MADE A DEPARTMENT TABLE SO USE THE SNIPPET ABOVE ^

    SELECT e.COUNT(*), d.DNO, d.DNAME
    FROM employee e
    JOIN department d ON e.Department_No = d.DNO
    GROUP BY e.Department_No;

iii)    UPDATE works_on
        SET Pno = 01
        WHERE SSN = 'E03';
